# Security Policy

## Supported Version

Security fixes are applied to the current `main` branch of `claude-mem-cosmos-db`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for sensitive security reports.

Preferred process:

1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository if it is available.
2. If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainer directly on GitHub before public disclosure.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigation

You will receive acknowledgement as soon as practical, and fixes will be prepared before public disclosure when possible.

## Upstream Coordination

This repository is a fork of `thedotmack/claude-mem`. If a reported vulnerability also affects upstream, disclosure may require coordinated fixes across both repositories.
